My final year project for my Computer Science degree at Newcastle University.

My intention for this software is to investigate the viability of generating
a model from source files and performing analysis on the model to try to
find issues with the source files. I rely heavily on using RegEx for matching 
code from the source files so it can be loaded into objects that can be 
serialised to and from JSON.

As a proof of concept this is ***far*** from being even remotely production
ready, and would benefit greatly from a rewrite in a faster language such
as Rust, however I chose python for its flexibility and my familiarity with
it.

It's been fun though! üòÅ
